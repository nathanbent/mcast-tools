# mcast-tools

A collection of multicast tools, written in Rust. The first set is audio:
uncompressed PCM over RTP multicast, using the same L16/L24 payloads as AES67.

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

On Debian/Ubuntu install the build dependencies first (ALSA for audio devices, libopus for Opus):

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libasound2-dev libopus-dev
```

## Audio

Send a test tone, a WAV file, or live input:

```bash
mcast audio send --tone 440                    # 440 Hz at -12 dBFS
mcast audio send --wav music.wav --loop        # L16 at the file's own rate/channels
mcast audio send --capture                     # default input device
mcast audio send --capture "USB" -g 239.69.0.5:5004 -e l24
```

Senders announce their stream with SAP/SDP, so receivers find it on their own:

```bash
mcast audio send --name "Lobby" --tone 440     # announced as "Lobby"
mcast audio discover                           # list announced streams (+ added, - ended)
mcast audio recv                               # play the first stream announced
mcast audio recv --stream lobby                # play the stream whose name contains "lobby"
mcast audio recv --stream lobby --wav out.wav --duration 10
```

To skip discovery, give the group and format yourself:

```bash
mcast audio recv -g 239.69.0.1:5004 -r 48000 -c 2 -e l16 --latency 20 --device "Speakers"
```

List devices with `mcast audio devices`.

### Codecs

| Codec | `-e` | Rate / channels | Default ptime, payload type |
|---|---|---|---|
| L16, L24 | `l16`, `l24` | any (48 kHz stereo by default) | 1 ms, 96 (10/11 for 44.1 kHz L16) |
| G.711 µ-law | `pcmu` / `g711u` | 8 kHz mono | 20 ms, 0 |
| G.711 A-law | `pcma` / `g711a` | 8 kHz mono | 20 ms, 8 |
| G.722 | `g722` | 16 kHz mono | 20 ms, 9 |
| Opus | `opus` | 48 kHz, mono (or `-c 2`) | 20 ms, 107 |

All of them can be sent and received. The G.711 and G.722 encoders and decoders
produce byte-for-byte the same output as ffmpeg's.

Sending converts the source to the codec's rate and channels (high-quality
windowed-sinc resampling, stereo averaged to mono), so any WAV file or input
device works with any codec:

```bash
mcast audio send -e g711u --wav page.wav -g 239.192.2.1:10000 --tos 184     # paging, DSCP EF
mcast audio send -e g722 --wav page.wav -g 239.192.2.1:10000
mcast audio send -e opus --opus-mode voice --bitrate 32 --opus-bandwidth wb --capture
```

Opus options: `--bitrate` (kbit/s, default 64), `--opus-mode voice|music`,
`--opus-bandwidth nb|wb|swb|fb`, `--no-fec` (in-band FEC is on by default, tuned for 5% loss).
`--ptime` and `--pt` override the defaults above.

Receiving: streams announced via SAP need no flags. With `--group`, G.711 and
G.722 are detected from the payload type; Opus needs `-e opus`:

```bash
mcast audio recv -g 239.192.2.1:10000               # G.711 or G.722, codec from payload type
mcast audio recv -g 239.192.2.1:10000 -e opus       # Opus
mcast audio recv -g 239.192.2.1:10000 --wav page.wav
```

Lost Opus packets are rebuilt from the next packet's FEC data, or concealed by libopus.

### Discovery details

- Senders announce every 5 s (`--sap-interval`) on 239.255.255.255:9875, the
  group AES67/Dante devices use, and send a SAP deletion when they stop.
  `--no-sap` turns it off; `--sap-group` picks another group.
- Receivers listen on 239.255.255.255, 239.195.255.255 and 224.2.127.254
  (ffmpeg's default), so they also see AES67 devices and `ffmpeg -f sap` streams.
  Streams in formats we can't decode (e.g. G.729) are listed but skipped.
- `send --sdp stream.sdp` writes the SDP to a file, for players like
  `ffplay -protocol_whitelist file,udp,rtp stream.sdp` or VLC.
- ffmpeg can play our streams straight from SAP: `ffplay sap://239.255.255.255`.

Defaults: group `239.69.0.1:5004`, 48 kHz, 2 channels, L16, 1 ms packets, TTL 16.

Network options:

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-g, --group` | Group and port, IPv4 or IPv6 (`[ff15::69]:5004`) |
| `-i, --iface` | IPv4 interface address, or interface index for IPv6 |
| `--ttl` | TTL / hop limit |
| `--no-loopback` | Don't deliver to receivers on the same host |

## Layout

| Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `crates/mcast-core` | Multicast sockets (v4/v6), RTP, SAP announce/directory, SDP parse/write |
| `crates/mcast-audio` | Codecs (L16/L24, G.711, G.722, Opus), resampler, packetizer, jitter buffer, sender & receiver, device I/O (cpal) |
| `crates/mcast` | The `mcast` CLI |

New tool families go in their own crate (e.g. `crates/mcast-<thing>`) and get a
subcommand in the CLI.

## Roadmap ideas

- Audio: PTP-aligned timestamps (AES67), resampling on playback, voice processing (filters/loudness) like mcast-play.sh
- Monitor: join groups and show rate, loss, jitter
- Other: file transfer, chat, ping/latency, relay/bridge between interfaces
